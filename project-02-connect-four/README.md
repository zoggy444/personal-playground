# Connect 4

For this project I decided to use playwright-bdd instead of cucumber.
It took A LOT of effort to manage to get the "beforeAll" to work like it does on cucumber.
I ended up rebuilding my app from scratch at some point but I managed to get it to work.

For the separation BDD vs TDD I decided to start with BDD scenarios and build the app structure.
Then, I would implement the lower level features through TDD.
Specifically, I wrote the "win condition" function with TDD process.

I decided I would not get to much into UI/UX (again) for this project.
For now I still need to practice my development life cycle, the tools, the code.
Once I have a few projects under my belt, I'll unify them with a single design system.
It's gonna be a whole project in and of itself !

I'm starting to get more comfortable with TypeScript and Playwright.
I didn't get to practice React a lot yet.

It's time for my *Next* challenge !
